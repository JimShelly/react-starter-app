## React Start App

This is what I came up with for a good starting point of a React app.  

**Requirements**
* Nodejs
* yarn (npm install -g yarn)
* babel-loader, babel-core, babel-preset-es2015 and babel-preset-react
* css-loader, scss-loader, style-loader
* html-webpack-plugin
* react, react-dom
* redux, redux-saga

I got most of the above configuration from [here][https://scotch.io/tutorials/setup-a-react-environment-using-webpack-and-babel#toc-html-webpack-plugin].  This is an outstanding tutorial on
setting up a React front-end application.  I used the create-react-app, and although I really liked it, I wanted better control of my application structure.  And since I'm in the learning
phase of React I didn't to rely on the "training wheels" of the *create-react-app* for long.

So if anyone stumbles across this and finds it useful please let me know.

**Setup**
* Clone this this repo
* Make sure you have nodejs and yarn installed
* yarn install
* yarn start
